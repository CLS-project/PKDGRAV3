**CLASS**

The CLASS :cite:p:`2011JCAP...07..034B` code is used to generate linear values for
cosmological observables given specific cosmological parameters. This code can be
used directly to produce a transfer function that is suitable as an input to the
IC generation of PKDGRAV3, or it can be used in combination with Concept for more
advanced features.

**CONCEPT**

The CONCEPT code :cite:p:`2022MNRAS.513..991D,2023ascl.soft06035D` can be use
to generate an HDF5 file with tabulated values from CLASS :cite:p:`2011JCAP...07..034B`.
This file can be use as an input to PKDGRAV3 to provide the cosmology for
initial conditions, and for the treatment of linear species.

**CAMB**

CAMB :cite:p:`2000ApJ...538..473L,2011ascl.soft02026L` is another code that is
commonly used to generate transfer function.

**MUSIC**

The MUSIC :cite:p:`2011MNRAS.415.2101H` code is a tool that can is used to generate
initial conditions. It is particularly well suited to multi-scale (zoom) simulations.
